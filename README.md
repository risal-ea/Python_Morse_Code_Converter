# Python_Morse_Code_Converter

This repository contains a Python script that allows you to convert text into Morse code. The Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes.

**Features**

1. Converts any given text into Morse code.

2. Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and basic punctuation marks.

4. Handles spaces between words and ignores unknown characters.

Examples

Here are a few examples of how the Morse code converter works:

1. Input: "HELLO".
Output: ".... . .-.. .-.. ---"
2. Input: "OpenAI"
Output: "--- .--. . -. .- .."
3. Input: "12345"
Output: ".---- ..--- ...-- ....- ....."
4. Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: ".... . .-.. .-.. --- --..-- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--"

**Acknowledgements**

This Morse code converter script is inspired by the International Morse Code standard. The mappings of characters to their respective Morse code representations are based on the commonly used conventions.

Please note that this code is for educational purposes and may not cover all variations of Morse code used across different countries or organizations.
